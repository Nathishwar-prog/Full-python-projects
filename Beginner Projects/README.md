# Python Mini-Beginner-Projects Collection
# Coded By : Nathishwar
A collection of simple, text-based Python programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts without using external libraries or classes.

## Projects Included

1. **Simple Calculator**
   - A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Number Guessing Game**
   - Try to guess a randomly generated number between 1-100 with limited attempts.

3. **Text-Based Adventure Game**
   - A choose-your-own-adventure style game with multiple paths.

4. **Rock Paper Scissors Game**
   - Classic hand game against the computer.

5. **Basic Contact Book**
   - Store and view contact names and phone numbers.

6. **Word Count Tool**
   - Counts characters and words in input text.

7. **Dice Rolling Simulator**
   - Simulates rolling a standard 6-sided die.

8. **Simple Timer/Stopwatch**
   - Measures elapsed time with start/stop functionality.

9. **Hangman Game**
   - Guess letters to uncover a hidden word before running out of attempts.

10. **Temperature Converter**
    - Converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

11. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**
    - Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term.

## How to Use

1. Each program is contained in its own Python file.
2. Simply run the desired program using Python:
   ```
   python filename.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions for each program.

## Features

- No external dependencies - uses only Python's built-in functions
- No classes or complex object-oriented programming
- Simple, text-based interfaces
- Input validation and error handling
- Self-contained and easy to understand

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Notes

- These programs are designed for educational purposes and demonstrate fundamental programming concepts.
- The random number generation in some games uses simple time-based methods rather than the random library.
- All programs are intentionally kept simple to focus on core programming logic.

Enjoy exploring these mini-projects!
